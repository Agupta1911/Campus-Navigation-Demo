# Campus-Navigation
A graph processing program that analyzes campus connectivity using different graph algorithms.

The program will read a campus map from a file and allow users to explore different paths and connections between campus buildings using DFS, BFS, find the MST using Kruskal’s algorithm, and find the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

Instructions:

Follow prompts for user inputs, make sure the input files are correctly formatted, also make sure that the distance data is between 0 and 30 inclusive as I only consider valid data for edge distance as a maximum of 30
